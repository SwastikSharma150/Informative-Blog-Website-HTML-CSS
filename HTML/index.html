        The North American beaver is a semi-aquatic herbivorous animal with short front legs and is
        generally identified with its blackish brown hair colour from the outside.
        <q><em>Castor canadensis</em></q>
        is the scientific name of the American beaver. It is also one of the symbols of the

        The North American beaver is a native to North America so it can be seen in the United
        States Canada and Mexico. It has also been introduced in the following countries:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Russia</li>
        <li>Argentina</li>
        <li>Germany</li>
        <li>Finland</li>
        <li>Belgium</li>
        <li>Luxembourg</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Although the beaver is a native to North America, over the time it spread to other
        continents of the world like Europe and Asia. The beavers can be found in rivers, marshes,
        streams, ponds, lakes and wetland areas. While North American beavers are roughly 15 million
        in population across the North American sub-continent, their very similar sub-species known
        as, <q>Eurasian beavers</q> are distributed country-wise as follows:

        Physical Appearance
      </h2>
      <p>
        A North American beaver has long visible incisors that are worn down over the course of of
        its life by constant chewing. They have digitated front paws and webbed rear feet. Thanks to
        their huge lungs, beavers can swim up to 10 km/h and go more than half a mile underwater for
        up to 15 minutes. They also have whiskers, which help them sense objects surrounding their
        faces and head which is very helpful in confined spaces and in dark water.

      <p>
        The plump bodies of North American beavers exhibit features like having a yellowish brown
        dark coat and a large, flat, scaly tail. A beaver's tail can be anything between short and
        broad to long and narrow, and their vertebrae extend almost to the end of the tail. The
        nearly hairless tail, which is coated in black scales and used as a balancing aid when
        working on land and as a warning signal when slapped on the water, serves as a rudder for
        the animal while swimming. Additionally, beavers have fat reserves in their tails and
        frequently transition between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. American beavers have a
        length of 3 to 4 feet and a height of 1 to 1.5 feet. The beaver's tail can take many
        different forms, but it typically has a base thickness of around two inches and a tip
        thickness of about 0.24 inches.Their agile, tiny front feet are perfectly suited for
        functioning on land. They have well-developed digging claws.

        American beavers are monogamous, mate for life, and reach reproductive maturity at roughly 3
        years old for both genders. Kits develop their swimming ability within a week of birth, when
        they weigh around 1 pound (0.5 kilogrammes), have open eyes, and are totally coated in fur.
        On land, moms frequently carry kits on their broad tails or even walk upright while carrying
        them. Kits may lie on their mothers' backs while submerged.

        Above is the sound of a beaver mating call from water. American beavers mate for their
        entire lifetime and both genders remain sexually active. Between late January and early
        February, they mate, and the females give birth in the following spring.

      <blockquote style="background-color: black"; style="color: black;">
        According to the Natural Science Research Laboratory of Texas Tech University, pregnant
        female North American beavers typically remain pregnant for a total of 107 days.

      <h2 style="color: crimson" id="habitat_heading" class="heading">Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Beavers are one of the few creatures who modify their habitat; they create mud-caulked dams
        that are waterproof using sticks that are weaved with reeds, branches, and saplings. Dams
        create ponds that move slowly, which slows down stream erosion. These ponds supply water and
        food for many larger animals as well as habitat for a variety of little aquatic species.
        Beavers establish new habitats by erecting dome-like lodges that rise 6.5 feet or more and
        can reach widths of 39 feet that can sustain a very diversified biological community.

        They are commonly found in or around freshwater ponds, lakes, rivers, marshes and swamps
        living in their lodges. Living quarters are found on the top of the lodge, which is above
        the water line, and a lodge may have one or more submerged entrances. These lodges are
        frequently constructed inland, forming enclaves that can only be reached when underwater.

        Beavers spend the most of the day sleeping. However, in areas where ponds completely freeze
        over in the winter, beavers may hibernate in their lodges or beneath the ice, surviving on
        their fat stores and the food they have acquired. North American beavers generally live upto
        10 to 12 years.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: crimson" id="diet_heading" class="heading">Diet</h2>
      <p>
        Beavers are herbivores that consume leaves, woody stems and aquatic plants. Their primary
        construction materials: poplar, aspen, willow, birch, and maple - are also their favourite
        foods. They spend the winter within their lodge chamber in colder locations, eating twigs
        that have been kept on the mucky pond floor as winter food. The stems are kept cool and
        their nutritional worth is preserved by the water's role as a refrigerator. Beavers eat corn
        on the cob-style while holding their meal in their front paws.

      <p>
        According to the
        <abbr title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</abbr> Red List, American
        Beavers are classified as <q><strong>Least Concerned.</strong></q>
        Due to beavers being previously prized for their pelts, castoreum, and flesh, they went
        nearly extinct via hunting. The beaver's main predator, besides humans, is the wolf while
        other predators include bears, foxes and coyotes. They are widely distributed as of now,
        frequent over most of their habitat, and their population is now stable.
